## Hello Everyone
This is the base of the WhatsApp bot that I shared, <br>
you can use and experiment with the code that I gave, this is <br>
just the initial stage and does not have any <br>
features yet, you can add them later.

### Settings Owner
Go to the config.js file, you need to set <br>
some necessary things there.
